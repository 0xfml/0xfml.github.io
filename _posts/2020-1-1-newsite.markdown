<h1>New site time</h1>


I ended 2019 with a half assed static html site that i got fed up with maintaining and writing so i decided i would make a change. Since i still wanted to use github pages as a free method of hosting i chose to jump 
ship to jekyll. So far my experience has been good since its really straight forward to get up and running. <br>
Ill be using this space to host writups, guides and random infosec related articles.
