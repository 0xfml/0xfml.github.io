# My experience and reflection on university
Date: 13/4/2020

To preface this post, i have to say that these views are purely mine and not of my employer or any other persons. All experiences are my own and company names are removed. Im writing this post not to deter people from attending or to badmouth certain institutions but instead offer an insight that may not be given otherwise.
<br>
In this post i wanted to express my pure **opinion** on my university experience. So if youre reading this before choosing a uni course this might help shed some light.

# My journey into security.
Since i was very young, i knew i wanted to work with computers one day. I was always tinkering with the home pc, looking for software at swapmeets and playing around with all sorts of things.
When i was ~7 i built my first pc from parts from these markets and just found on the streets. Building and servicing pcs for friends and family was something i got used to as im sure many people got the same treatment living at home. 
When i was in highschool i learnt more about the ever growing industry of security, i got into a habit of learning more and more about things to break and build on weekends and spare time between videogames and homework.
Once i discovered the backtrack project, i learnt how to setup and use virtual machines and would often be caught reading up on attacks and tools on class time by teachers.
It was around then i chose to buy hardcopies of both 'Penetration Testing: A hands-on intro to hacking' and 'The hacker playbook (1)'. These books gave me my first insight into ethical hacking as well as many attack methods and vectors i had never dreamt were possible. It inspired me to dive deeper into security and get to know tools and lower level computer science structures like the osi model. At this point in highschool i was being taught visual basic in classes and regardless of the language, it taught me to become code literate and knowledgable of all kinds of terminology and syntax within windows. I found myself adding powershell scripting and even batch scripting into programs i was writing at school.

Around the end of highschool, i was still playing a lot of video games but it got to a point where i determined i would never make money off doing so and needed to find something that would. Thats when i decided to put the games away and get more and more into security.
When end of year exam results came out i didnt quite come out as i expected, i got slightly lower than what i expected due to the way the scaling works on some subjects in Australia. This cause me to get bumped to my 2nd preference on my university list. Still not bad but i knew less about this choice than i now wish i had.

Within the first semester at uni i attended an event setup by a company looking to potentially hire graduates, at the time i figured it wouldnt be a bad idea to get to know some potential employers so i went. When waiting around to go in i saw someone i recognised from pre-uni days, i couldnt quite remember so continued thinking about it during the company sellout. When we were packing up to leave it suddenly hit me that i used to work at my part time job with this person and approached them to say hi. As it turned out, this person was now in charge of the universities security club and invited me to attend the following wednesday.
Joining the uni club was probably the best decision ive made at uni. It got me involved with ctfs and people who had the same interests as me. 
I would attend every club session at uni regardless of if i had classes or not. Through this i got more involved with ctfs and infosec in general. This lead on with getting involved with a team to play the annual national CTF competition. This pushed me harder to learn new things because i felt i hadnt played ctfs as much as others and needed experience in areas id never touched before. 
As the competition grew closer, i got put into a different team, this team consisted of 3 guys who had much more knowledge of all kinds of things than me. I found myself learning new things all the time just talking to these guys and spending time talking about challenges and solutions. I probably learnt more from playing ctfs and preparing for this competition in a few short months compared to a year of university. 
As the competition date got even closer, the four of us in the team chose to travel to a infosec con in preparation for the competition and to get some more practice. At this conference i played my first onsite ctf and the team managed to secure 1st. 
At the actual competition wed been preparing for all this time the team managed to get 11th place overall. Not a bad result but a few errors we made made sure our shells never returned so there was a chance we could have reached top 10. Not a bad result overall and it ended up being a learning experience if nothing else.
Since then ive been attending as many infosec conferences as i can afford to, continue to play ctfs, study and learn in general.
Toward the end of my 2nd year i totally checked out, mentally and physically, i wouldnt attend lectures and would hardly read the notes online. I decided i would rather spend my time to teach myself the OSCP content and get that qualification instead. During this time i spend the majority of hours in a day working through that coursework and labs rooting as many boxes as i could and reading articles and guides on how to get the next one. If i get around to it, ill write up a post about the OSCP process and how i went about it. The main reason behind checking out was mainly my frustration of the course content and what laid ahead.
<br>
Looking forward, right now ive defered from uni to focus more on personal learning and trying to get my foot into the industry. Im not sure what my future at university will be like or whether ill go back or not. Right now im focusing on low level stuff and the content around OSCE. Ill write about that more when i get to it. For now, the grind continues.



# My issues
When getting involved more and more in the club at uni, i would constantly hear complains from more senior students about out of date software and course content. This should have been a warning to keep me aware of things to come. As i mention further in this post, security is an industry that is constantly shifting. Teaching content no longer relevant due to retired system architectures or software on outdated operating systems not able to run new FOSS tooling ticked something in my head.
Next is something the people who know me have had a pleasure of listening to me rant about many a time. In first year at this educational institution, they teach a introductory programming unit designed for students new to this area to pick up fundamental programming skills to take forward. In this case the language of choice is a wrapper for c++ designed by the unit chair. Meaning a compiler and unique code structure has been built to replace what i would consider an standard language that serves without issue. My problem with this is that unknowinly, students who pass this unit will be putting that they are knowledable in c++ on resumes and job applications as the unit is marketed that way. When they get to a practical interview or even a job and cannot import the unit chairs custom library to work from they will only run into issues. I, for the life of me cannot understand the reasoning on teaching a language like this in tertiary education. Especially when just years prior it was standard C#. I understand people have different needs in programming but my advice would be to simply teach python, its something very easy to pickup and has a playground of libraries to offer all types of capabilities. Perfect for an intro class.
This next one was a result of a friend of mine but the issue speaks volumes about what goes down internally. One lecture, the lecturer leading the session structured around ethical hacking made a point of saying that 'hackers dont need to know how to write code...'. This is something thats stuck with me, for students who dont know better or how security works, if they want jobs as pentesters and put off learning to code they will only run into issues in my opinion. Teaching staff at this particular uni are required to be 2 disciplines above what they wish to teach, meaning they _should_ have relevant experience behind them to offer quality advice to junior students. This is not what i witnessed from most tutors who i had teaching IT based classes. 
I remember one particular event quite stronly just because of how it all played out. It all revolves around a unit i wasnt impressed with from day 1 and should have bailed sooner than i did. Basically, i chose to pick a web design elective one trimester and within the first lecture, the unit chair was making mistakes on simple html. This should have been enough of a warning for me to GTFO, instead i stayed. One week we had an assignment due, it was for a majority mark and most of my work was complete, a day before it was due a family member of mine dislocated and broke their foot in an accident and required multiple surgeries to get it put right. Instead of sitting at home writing up supportive documentation, i was in hospital making sure i could help out doing what needed doing for my family. In anticipation for the emails from uni, i sent one directly to the unit chair asking for more time under my circumstances. This was met with a simple one line of 'you can have 24 hours'. At the time, i just remember thinking, what am i supposed to do while sitting in a hospital with no computer and 24 hours to finalise a major unit defining project. Im not trying to be pedantic here but in all fairness i believe i should have been granted some leniancy in this case.
Toward the end of the year, myself and a few others were putting up our time to offer other students who wished to play the countries annual CTF. This was met by promises by the senior university staff of corporate partner training as well as online training resources to be paid. Weeks went by and we recieved nothing, no support financially or otherwise. This for me was really disapointing as our success in such competitions is played as the institutes name when it was really just the few of us who were responsible for the outcome. Id does annoy me that my efforts to better students and diversly the universities name was met with no appreciation from the latter. 

# My advice
1. Do your research before attending. Make an active effort to consult students or graduates of the course youre interested in to get a better idea on what to expect ahead of you.
This is something i didnt do and went purley by the content online and through advertisments. What i didnt know at the time was theres plenty of people out there at open days that can give information on the insides of the course, this does have some caveats though. 
Keep in mind that lecturers and teaching staff will tell you different things, they are employees after all. Im not saying you shouldnt trust their word, its just you cant deny bias from someone who is being paid by the institution. Universities are a business before an educator. 
2. Set limits and be honest with yourself, if youre enrolled and fed up, do something. Dont sit around and rack up debt or waste your time. Youre in a race to get a job in a market that doesnt need a thousand juniors.

3. Interest vs passion. If youre not passionate and not willing to wake up every morning to do the job, consider your chances. Is it worth spending time studying this? I know its hard to know exactly what you want to do when you leave highschool but you need to start thinking. If this is you it might be best to choose a generalised degree with room to move when you have a feel around.

4. Learn to self learn. Dont allow people to be responsible for your learning. Self learning is something you will need to be determined to do if you want to get ahead. University is not the be all end all, you will need to teach yourself all kinds of things if you want to get the job you desire. 

5. Use university as a place to meet people. This is what i got most out of university. From my experience, at the end of the day, its who you know that will get you an interview for a job. Get involved with university clubs and surround yourself with people who speak the same language as you (metaphorically speaking).

6. Use the library. Regardless of what lectures and tutorials may contain, the university library contains a plethora of information written my all kinds of greatly informed people and pure experts in their field. The university library is usually free, use it, go look through the section youre interested in and pick out and read the books you find interest in. It will arguably teach you more than your classes.

7. University will not change for you. Ive heard too many times that 'we cant offer that due to xyz..' or 'that wouldnt be in the budget'. While i understand this, it just goes to prove point 1, 2 and 4.

8. Do extra curriculars. Play CTFS, get on hackthebox, vulnhub, bugbounty sites, whatever, work with step 4 and teach yourself stuff. Do yourself a favor and watch defcon videos on youtube and visit nostarchpress for amazing learning resources to get started with.

<br>
While attending a university competition, i got fed some advice thats managed to stick. That was, as simple as it sounds, 
**'Just do stuff. Doesnt matter what it is as long as it gets you to where you want to go. Just do stuff...'**
It is simple to say but does mean more when you think about it and its something i think about when i sit down at my desk everyday.
In an industry like security, you need to move with the crowd, you shouldnt be falling behind on new issues and techniques that you may need to use in an engagment or to get yourself a job. So, in turn you should simply 'do stuff', this will keep you and your mind active and uptodate.


# Do i stay or do i go?
I cant make that choice. Everyones experince and situation differs. There are skills employers will look for that you can and cannot direclty learn from university. But there are things people cannot teach you too. 
Remeber that at this stage you are an adult, there may be choices you have to make yourself but there will almost always be someone to lend advice. University is not something youre trapped into doing, take breaks even, the offers to defer are there you just have to look. In my experience staff are often willing to help fit the course around personal issues that arise, sometimes not but most are on the better side, especially the admin support staff.
As ive said before, i cant say that every uni experience will be like mine, but be prepared for it to be not what you expect. Ask questions and dont be lazy about the process. 
I hope this post helps someone to make an informed decision on which pathway in their education pathway to take, at least some advice to think about.
