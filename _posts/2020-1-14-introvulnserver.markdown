Vulnserver is a vulnerable server (duh) for learning exploitation written by [stephenbradshaw](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver).  It has many different vulnerable functions that ill hopefully get through, it was suggested to me to practice stack based overflows, seh overwrites and egghunters for the OSCE course. 



Vulnserver series:
```
 - KSTET egghunter
 - GMON seh
 - KSTET socket reuse
 - TRUN overflow
 - LTER seh
 - GTER egghunter


vulnserver 1 - kstet egghunter
```
